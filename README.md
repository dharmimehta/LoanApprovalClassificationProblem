# LoanApprovalClassificationProblem
You are a data scientist for a large regional bank.  Your task is to create a prediction model that could be used to automate loan approval decisions. 
Note: please be aware that there are some fields in this dataset that you WOULD NOT be allowed to use in practice (at least not in the U.S. or Europe).  
You are welcome to use all available features, but please think about the ethical issues surrounding the possibility of using variables like ethnicity, age, etc. 
when deciding to approve or reject a loan application.
